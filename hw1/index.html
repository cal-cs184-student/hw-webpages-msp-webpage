		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this project, I implemented triangle rasterization with supersampling 
		antialiasing as well as several texture sampling and antialiasing methods. 
		I started by making a simple triangle rasterizer that performs 3 line tests 
		to determine if points are inside of a triangle, and displays them if so. 
		Then, I added supersampling capabilities to this triangle rasterizer, which 
		takes multiple samples in each pixel and averages the color values to achieve
		antialiasing. Then, I completed the transform functions for translate, rotate, 
		and scale using homogenous coordinate transform matrices, allowing me to easily 
		transform shapes in svg files. I then implemented a function which allowed me to 
		convert an x,y coordinate inside a triangle into barycentric coordinates, 
		and interpolate colors using these values. This is essential for the next part, 
		where I implemented texture mapping onto triangles using u,v coordinates. 
		Along with this, I used bilinear interpolation to generate a best estimate 
		color sample for a given u,v coordinate. To follow this up I added a mipmap 
		level sampling functionality, with both nearest level sampling as well as 
		a linear interpolation between levels. At the end, I had built a program 
		that can rasterize svg files with texture mapping and various kinds of 
		antialiasing including supersampling and trilinear filtering!

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		To rasterize a triangle, I am essentially taking a sample at the center 
		of each pixel that is relevant to the triangle (inside its bounding box) 
		and testing to see if it is inside the triangle. To then determine if the 
		point is actually inside the triangle,  
		I do 3 line tests, each of which determine which side of the line the point 
		is on. Depending on the winding order of the triangle, the values from the 
		line tests must be all non-negative or all non-positive in order for the point 
		to be inside or on the edge of the triangle. To account for this, I first 
		determine the winding order of the triangle and use a multiplier of 1 if 
		it is counter clockwise and -1 if it is clockwise. I multiply the result 
		of the line tests by this multiplier, which allows me to check that all 
		of the values are non-negative to tell if the point is inside the triangle.
		If the sample is inside of the triangle, that pixel is rendered with the color 
		of the triangle.
		<br/>
		<br/>

		I am ensuring that only samples within the bounding box of the triangle 
		are checked by taking the minimum x and y values of all of the vertices and 
		the maximum x and y values of all the vertices. I use these values as the 
		corner of the box from which I take samples. This makes it so I will always 
		sample the whole triangle but will not sample anything outside of the bounding 
		box.

		<br/>
		<br/>

		Here is an example rendering of the test4.svg file:

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		For my supersampling algorithm, I first increased the size of the sample buffer 
		by a factor of the sampling rate so that it could hold all of the samples. 
		I added a helper function that would supersample a single pixel given an 
		input triangle. This loops through all the sample positions in the pixel 
		based on the sampling rate, and uses the same algorithm to sample each point. 
		The sample positions are determined by evenly dividing the pixel into 
		an n by n grid, where n is the square root of the sampling rate. Samples 
		are taken at the center of each of these sub-pixels.
		I then save each sample into the sample buffer, essentially creating a 
		very high-resolution rendering. After all triangles and 
		lines have been supersampled and rasterized into the sample buffer, I average the samples 
		over each pixel and store this into the frame buffer. This gives us the 
		final antialiased image.

		</div>

		As the sampling rate increases, we get fewer jagged edges and disconnected
		pixels, because we are able to capture higher frequencies with our samples. 
		Then, we downsample to get an antialiased image.

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>

		In this image, I've modified cubeman using the transform functions I defined. 
		Here, cubeman is waving hello!

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		My understanding of barycentric coordinates is a method of representing  
		interior points of a triangle as a linear combination of the three vertices. 
		We use variables alpha, beta, and gamma to represent the "weight" of each 
		of the three vertices in this combination. The image below on the left 
		illustrates this nicely, with the colors being solid red, green, and blue 
		at the corners of the triangles, where the barycentric coordinates are 
		(1,0,0), (0,1,0), or (0,0,1). As we move towards the center of the triangle,
		the colors begin to blend according to the values of the barycentric coordinates. 
		Along each of the edges, only two colors are blended, because the third 
		coordinate remains at 0.

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		Pixel sampling is when we sample for the color of each pixel  
		using a texture image. When sampling from a texture, we 
		first assign a u,v coordinate to the pixel, and then use that coordinate to 
		find the correct color from the texture. In this case, we have triangles with 
		u,v coordinates mapped to each vertex. We can then interpolate u,v coordinates 
		for the entire triangle using barycentric coordinates. 
		Since the pixels of the texture might not line up exactly with the u,v coordinates for 
		the pixels on the display, we often need a method to decide 
		what color to sample in these scenarios. The nearest pixel method is to simply find 
		the nearest texture pixel to the u, v coordinate in the texture image, and use that color. 
		For bilinear interpolation, we find the 4 nearest pixels in the texture image and use 
		these to get an interpolated color value. To do this, we first interpolate 
		along 2 edges of this 4-pixel square, and then interpolate between these two new points
		to get to the desired u,v coordinate. This estimates the color of the 
		exact u, v coordinate that we want to sample.

		<br/>

		Bilinear interpolation looks significantly more smooth and antialiased 
		than nearest pixel, even after 16x supersampling. This is because when we 
		are sampling textures at a given u, v coordinate, if this coordinate does 
		not exactly line up with a texel, nearest pixel is going to give us an 
		inaccurate representation of the color at that u, v coordinate, espeically 
		in high-frequency areas. Bilinear interpolation may also give us somewhat inaccurate 
		values, but they will likely be much more accurate because we are making 
		a better estimate using bilinear interpolation between 4 texels. There 
		will likely be the largest difference between the two methods in areas where 
		the color changes at a high frequency (edges, etc.), because the nearest pixel 
		method could give color values that are actually not close to the "correct" color 
		at this coordinate.

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		Level sampling uses several different "levels" of texture images which are 
		progressively downsampled. We calculate the level we want to use for a given 
		pixel by calculating the rate of change of u and v on the texture relative to 
		x and y in the screen pixel space, essentially finding the relative footprint
		of a screen pixel compared to a texture pixel. After calculating these rates of
		change, we use the maximum from either the x direction or y direction, and get the 
		desired level from the base 2 log of this value. If the pixels and texels have a roughly 
		1 to 1 mapping, this will result in a level close to 0, which is just the full 
		resolution texture. As the level increases, we will use lower and lower resolution 
		textures. This allows us to map lower detail textures 
		to areas where the texture is very dense relative to the pixel size, effectively 
		decreasing the maximum frequency in order to more closely match the sampling rate. 
		There are a couple methods for determining which level of mipmap to use from the 
		non-integer result of the level function.  
		Nearest level simply rounds our value for the level to the nearest whole number, 
		whereas linear interpolation samples both the level above and below our calculated 
		level value and takes a weighted average of the two samples.

		<br/>

		For level sampling, always using level 0 is the fastest method but looks 
		the worst. Nearest level is performs more calculations and is therefore slower, 
		but has significantly improved 
		texture antialiasing. Linear interpolation is a bit slower with smoother 
		edges/fewer jaggies in the texture.

		<br/>

		Nearest pixel sampling gives significant aliasing in the texture. Bilinear 
		interpolation is a bit slower as it involves taking 4 samples per pixel and 
		doing 3 linear interpolations, but produces a much clearer image.

		<br/>

		Each increased level of supersampling gives an image that has better antialiasing 
		than the previous, although at 16x it seems to have diminishing returns. 
		Supersampling is slower due to needing to take multiple samples for each pixel 
		and also requires significantly more memory for the sample buffer.
