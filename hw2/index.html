		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, I implemented a method of mesh creation using bezier curves 
		and surfaces. I first created a function that evaluated de Casteljau's algorithm 
		over a set of control points, and then I used this to create a bezier surface 
		by doing a sort of 2D interpolation where I used points on a set of bezier curves as 
		control points to create another bezier curve, which defined the surface. 
		I then built several functions for mesh editing: edge splitting and 
		edge flipping. Using these functions, I was able to implement a loop subdivision 
		algorithm which can smooth and add resolution to 3d meshes.

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		De Casteljau's algorithm is a method for evaluating a bezier curve over 
		an arbitrary number of control points. It achieves this by finding 
		intermediate points along the lines connecting the control points, and 
		then connecting these lines and repeating until there is only a single 
		point. To determine how far along each line we place the intermediate 
		point, we use a value  
		\( t \) with \( 0 \le t \le 1 \), where \( t \) is the proportional 
		distance along the connecting line. We can create a smooth curve by 
		iterating through possible t values at a desired resolution and 
		constructing a curve.

		<br/>
		<br/>

		I implemented this by completing the <code>evaluateStep()</code> function, 
		which performs a single step of the above algorithm. I did this by iterating 
		through the first n-1 input points (where there are n total points) and 
		performing a linear interpolation between each of these points and the 
		next point with parameter t from the class member variable. Then, I 
		return the vector of these n-1 interpolated points.

		<p>Here are some screenshots dsiplaying the functionality of the implementation:</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		Implementing this part was fairly straightforward after completing the 
		previous step. To create a bezier surface from an \( n \times n \) matrix of control 
		points, I first ran de Casteljau's algorithm on each row of points using 
		the given \(u\) value, and then I ran de Casteljau's algorithm on this new 
		set of calculated points with the given \(v\) value. This finds a single point 
		on the bezier surface, and we can repeat this process with as many \(u,v\) 
		values as we like to interpolate a smooth bezier surface. Below is a 
		rendering of the teapot.bez file using my bezier surface implementation:

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		To implement area weighted vertex normals, I first had to find all of the 
		faces connected to the vertex. I do this by getting a half edge associated 
		with the vertex. Then, I move through the half edges in a cycle of 
		next->next->twin, recording each half edge on the vertex until I have reached 
		the degree of the vertex. Once I have all of the half edges of a given 
		vertex, I will then loop through them all and take the cross product of 
		the half edge with its next half edge, to get a vector that is both normal 
		to the face and proportional to the area. I sum all of these normal vectors 
		together, and then normalize them to get the area weighted unit normal vector. 
		Below, we can this in use to create the illusion of a smooth surface through 
		shading based on normal vector interpolation.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		To implement edge flip, I first had to figure out exactly which mesh 
		elements would need to have their pointers updated, and which pointers would 
		need to point where. After drawing it out, I found that I just needed to 
		modify the two half edge loops such that the edge was flipped. I changed 
		the vertices pointed to by the two half edges of the flipped edge, and 
		then redirected the loops accordingly. I initially thought that this implementation 
		would work, but I started running into an issue when doing repeated flips: 
		faces started to disappear. After looking through all of the mesh element 
		classes again, I realized that I needed to reassign the half edge pointers 
		for the faces after rearranging the half edge loops to ensure that the 
		half edge pointed to by each face was accurate. After implementing this fix, 
		the flip function was fully working. Below is an image showing edges being 
		flipped on the teapot model.

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		The most important part of implementing edge splits was carefully drawing 
		and labeling all of the existing mesh elements as well as all of the new 
		ones I would be creating with an edge split. To find the location of the 
		new vertex, I averaged the locations of the two vertices on the given 
		edge. Then, I reoriented this edge to end at the new vertex and added 
		3 additional edges connected to the new vertex and an existing vertex. 
		I added 2 half edges for each of these new edges, and properly linked 
		them to the other half edges. I then added 2 new faces. Finally, I made 
		sure that all of the elements were properly linked with a half edge per 
		the specifications. The only debugging issue I had here was not properly 
		instantiating the iterators and underlying mesh elements, resulting in 
		segfaults. After fixing this, it seemed to work properly. Below are some 
		examples of edge splits and edge flips.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		I implemented loop subdivision in a series of steps that made use of 
		both edge flipping and edge splitting. For one iteration of subdivision, 
		I first iterated through all vertices and stored a new position for them 
		based on the subdivision rules, to be used later. Then, I iterated through 
		all of the edges and did the same, but using the rules for new vertices 
		(these vertices have not been created yet, but will be during the edge 
		split phase). Then, I split all of the edges and flipped any newly generated edges 
		which were connected to both a new and old vertex. Finally, I went through and 
		updated the position of all vertices according to the stored values. I ran 
		into a couple issues while implementing this. Initially, the program was 
		going into an infinite loop during the edge splitting phase. As I was creating 
		new edges, they were being added to the edge list and then split again. 
		To fix this, I made a set of all the original edges and ensured that I was
		only splitting edges in this set. After fixing this, I ran into an issue where 
		edges were not being flipped after the first level of subdivision. I realized 
		that I had to set the <code>isNew</code> member variable of every vertex 
		back to false after each subdivision iteration, otherwise my implementation 
		would not be able to accurately identify which edges to flip.

		<br/>
		<br/>

		As seen below, applying this subdivision algorithm smooths meshes, especially 
		sharp edges.

		By splitting edges before subdividing, the smoothing effect can be reduced. 
		However, it also tends to create odd shapes on the surface when subdividing. 
		We also see that as this cube is subdivided, it becomes asymmetric. I believe this 
		is because of the way the original mesh is constructed. Some of the corner vertices 
		of the cube have a degree of 4, and some have a degree of 5. This causes 
		different behavior in the subdivision algorithm because vertex positions are 
		updated differently depending on their degree. As the subdivision continues, 
		this difference propagates. This effect can be alleviated by splitting each 
		edge that crosses a face, such that the corners all have equal degree, as 
		seen below:
