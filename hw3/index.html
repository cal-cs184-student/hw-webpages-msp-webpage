		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, I implemented rendering a scene using ray tracing. First, 
		I added ray generation using random position sampling in each pixel. Then, I 
		implemented intersection algorithms for both triangles and spheres in the scene. 
		To speed up ray tracing, I added bounding volume heirarchies. This allowed me 
		to calculate intersections with the scenes much more quickly by discarding 
		triangles irrelevant to a given ray and never performing intersection tests on 
		them. After this, I added rendering functionality for direct lighting using 
		both uniform sampling as well as important sampling, which reduces noise by 
		only taking samples from light sources. To generate more realistic looking 
		scenes, I added global illumination, which adds upon direct lighting by 
		calculating radiance from ray paths which bounce 2 or more times before reaching 
		the camera. The aim is to recreate the infinite bounces that light may take in 
		the real world. Since this is impossible to do in rendering, we used a technique 
		called russian roulette, where at each bounce, there is a certain probability 
		that the ray terminates. This gives an unbiased sample without needing to 
		infinitely calculate bounces. Finally, in the last part I added adaptive 
		sampling, which uses an algorithm to determine which parts of the scene are 
		more difficult to sample accurately and which parts are fairly simple to sample. 
		Using this calculation, it will dynamically adjust how many samples are taken 
		at each pixel during the rendering process, which saves a lot of time and 
		computation power.


		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		Generating rays from the camera is how we estimate the light entering the 
		camera from the scene. For each pixel in the framebuffer, we generate a certain 
		number of rays which go through a randomized point inside the pixel. By averaging 
		the estimated radiance in each of these rays, we can get a more accurate 
		representation of the pixel's color. For each of these rays, we also need to 
		find out where it intersects with the scene in order to simulate a real ray 
		of light. I implemented algorithms which tested rays for intersection with a 
		triangle as well as a sphere. For triangle intersection, I used the Moller 
		Trumbore algorithm. This algorithm first calculates the vectors representing 
		two edges of the triangle. If the cross product of these edges is parallel to 
		the ray direction, then there is no intersection. Then, we perform a series of vector calculations 
		on these vectors as well as the ray origin and direction vectors in order to 
		find the values \( t, \beta, \gamma \), which represent the distance along the 
		ray where it intersects the triangle's plane, and 2 of the barycentric coordinates 
		for the location of the intersection on the triangle. We can easily find \( \alpha \) 
		from the other two barycentric coordinates. If any of the barycentric coordinates 
		generated are negative, then there is no intersection.


		<p>Here are some example renderings with triangle and sphere ray intersection and normal shading</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
		In my BVH construction algorithm, I used the surface area heuristic to minimize 
		the estimated cost of left-right split points over 32 different splitting plane 
		locations along each axis. If the heuristic found that it was most efficient 
		to keep all of the primitives in a single bounding box, I turned the node into 
		a leaf node to avoid infinite recursion. Otherwise, this process continues 
		recrusively until the node has <code>max_leaf_size</code> elements, where it 
		is turned into a leaf. To implement the surface area heuristic, I used the 
		equation from lecture: 
		\[ C = C_{trav} + SA(L) \cdot T(L) + SA(R) \cdot T(L) \]
		Where \( C \) is the estimated cost of tracing a ray, \( C_{trav} \) is the 
		cost of traversing a node, \( SA() \) is the bounding box surface area function, 
		\( T() \) is the triangle count function, and \( L, R \) are the left and 
		right nodes based on the split we are examining. The surface area of the 
		bounding box of a node is proportional to the probability that it will be
		traversed. We are estimating the cost of traversing a node as the number of 
		triangles within the bounding box of that node. So, the equation represents 
		the estimated cost of a given split point by summing the products of the 
		surface area of the resulting nodes' bounding boxes and their number of triangles 
		(as well as the constant cost of traversing deeper in the tree).

		<br/>
		<br/>

		<p>Here are some example renderings of more complex scenes that would take a long 
		time without any BVH acceleration:</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				  <img src="img/planck.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Rendering of maxplanck.dae file</figcaption>
				</td>
			</table>
		</div>

		I compared the rendering times of CBlucy.dae both with and without BVH 
		acceleration to see how much speed up I achieved. Without BVH acceleration, 
		it took roughly 86 seconds to render this scene. With BVH, it took a mere 1.8 
		seconds. With complex scenes like this where there are many triangles in the 
		mesh, BVH provides a very large speedup. This is because without BVH, we have 
		to perform an intersection test on every single triangle in the mesh every 
		time we are evaluating a ray. With BVH, we only have to do \( O(\log(n)) \), 
		where \( n \) is the number of triangles,
		plane intersection tests to find BVH intersections down to a leaf node, and 
		then do triangle intersection tests on the triangles in the leaf 
		node, which is much fewer than the total number of triangles.

		<h2>Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
		The first implementation of direct lighting used uniform hemisphere sampling. 
		First, we trace a ray to find its intersection with the scene, if there is one. 
		Then, from the intersection point, we take uniformly random samples from the 
		hemisphere centered on the surface normal at the intersection. We then find the 
		zero-bounce radiance of these sample rays, input the values into the BSDF of the 
		surface, and calculate the average reflected radiance in the original ray's direction.

		<br/>
		<br/>

		The importance sampling equation is similar, but instead of sampling uniformly 
		from a hemisphere above the intersection point, we sample a fixed number of 
		times from each light source using the <code>sample_L()</code> function. This 
		ensures that all of our samples will come from light sources, so will all 
		contribute to the reflected radiance. Since we can't take an infinite number 
		of samples, this ensures that we will get valuable samples at every intersection 
		point. The goal is to simulate taking a very large number of samples over the 
		whole hemisphere without actually doing all that computing work.

		<p>Here are some examples of renderings using both of these sampling techniques</p>

		</div>

		As we can see in the comparison images between uniform hemisphere and importance 
		sampling, uniform hemisphere sampling creates a much noisier image. This 
		is to be expected, because we are randomly sampling from the hemisphere above 
		an intersection, meaning that we are not guaranteed to sample from a light source 
		if one exists. This creates dark intersection pixels where the light source was either not 
		sampled or inadequately sampled. With importance sampling, we have a much 
		smoother image with no noise, because we are ensuring that all of our light ray 
		reflection samples come from a light source, if one is in line of sight of the 
		ray intersection point.

		<h2>Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
		For global illumination, we need to add to our direct lighting function an 
		indirect lighting function. Luckily, the indirect lighting function is similar 
		to the hemisphere sampling direct lighting function, but with rays recursively cast from 
		an intersection point. To implement this, I added a max depth to the generated 
		rays in order to avoid infinite bounces, and then created a recursive function which, 
		at each intersection, evaluates the importance sampled direct lighting of that 
		point as well as the incoming reflected light from a randomly sampled ray. To 
		find this incoming reflected light, we trace the new sample ray to its intersection, 
		and perform the same calculation at this point. The outgoing light here is equal to the 
		incoming light at the previous point. This continues until we reach the maximum ray 
		depth. After adding russian roulette, there is a chance to stop tracing a ray 
		at every bounce, so its possible we stop tracing before the maximum depth. I used 
		a value of 0.65 for the continuation probability, or 0.35 for termination probability.

		The second and third bounces add a lot of lighting to the underside of objects, 
		or areas that are not directly exposed to a light. Without these bounces, we 
		only see light that bounces directly off of the object. Any areas that are not 
		hit directly by the light are completely dark. This is not how it works in reality, 
		as diffuse surfaces scatter light in all directions, and the light bounces infinitely. 
		So, these "unexposed" areas that are not hit directly by the light source still recieve 
		light from secondary, tertiary, and further bounces.

		<h2>Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>
		Adaptive sampling allows us to dynamically change the number of samples (rays) 
		per pixel we use while the renderer is running. We do this by using function 
		that determines whether or not a pixel has converged to a satisfactory level, 
		and stop sampling that pixel if so. In order to decide if the radiance at a 
		pixel has converged, we calculate the variance of the radiance we have sampled so 
		far at a given pixel. From there, we determine if the standard deviation 
		normalized by the square root of the number of samples is sufficiently small. 
		Essentially, we are checking to see how much the radiance value varies from 
		sample to sample, and if it is high, we know this is likely a difficult area 
		of the scene and will take more samples to converge. If it is low, it is likely 
		a simple area of the scene, and does not require us to take the full number of 
		samples. This allows us to use high sample per pixel values without 
		drastically increasing the rendering time.
