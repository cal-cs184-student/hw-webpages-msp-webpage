		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this project, I created a cloth simulator that can handle collisions with 
		spheres, planes, and itself. It uses properties of springs to emulate the behavior 
		of a real cloth using a grid of point masses. With this in place, I was able to 
		simulate the behavior of cloth in a variety of scenarios and modify different 
		properties of the cloth like density to observe the results. In addition, I created 
		several kinds of shaders for the cloth and other scene objects like Blinn-Phong,
		Bump, and Displacement map shaders. This added more realistic shading/lighting to 
		the simulation.

		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		In the first part, we simply created a grid of point masses and connected them 
		with springs to simulate the forces and constraints that parts of a cloth would experience in 
		reality.

		<p>In the images below, we can see the implementation of a cloth wireframe using point masses and constraints</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		In the cloth simulation, modifying the cloth parameters have the following effects:

		<br/>
		<br/>
		Spring constant
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Decreasing the spring constant lowers the elasticity of the cloth, making it 
		droop down and not retain its shape as well. The cloth is also less resistant 
		to folding with a lower spring constant. With a very low spring constant, the only 
		thing holding the cloth together is likely the clamping constraint in the code.

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/ks_low.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Low spring constant</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/ks_high.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>High spring constant</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<br/>
		<br/>
		Density
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Changing the density of the cloth has a similar effect to changing the spring 
		constant. A cloth with a lower density is more "floaty" in the way it falls, and 
		deforms less. A high density cloth falls quickly and deforms more, because the 
		point masses have more mass.

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/density_low.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Low density</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/density_high.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>High density</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<br/>
		<br/>
		Damping
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Decreasing the damping causes the cloth to fall more freely and continue moving 
		for a longer period of time, because the cloth is experiencing less friction. 
		With 0 damping, the cloth seems to fall and continue swinging forever, with a 
		lot of deformation. With very high damping, the cloth falls very slowly and 
		comes to rest almost immediately after falling, as it is experiencing a lot of 
		friction.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		To handle collisions with spheres and planes, I added code which first checks 
		if the cloth has collided with the object. For spheres, this is fairly simple: 
		if a pointmass is closer to the center of the sphere than its radius, a collision 
		has occurred. For planes, I calculated the dot product between the normal vector 
		of the plane and the vector from a point on the plane to the point mass, for 
		both the current position and last timestep position of the point mass. If there 
		is a change in sign between these two, then a collision occurred. To actually 
		correct for the collision, I calculated the point of collision assuming the 
		point mass traveled directly towards the object, and then set the pointmass's 
		position to be slightly above the collision point.

		<br/>
		<br/>

		<p>Below are some images of a cloth resting on a sphere</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/sphere_ks_low.png" width="600px"/>
						<figcaption>Cloth with low spring constant</figcaption>
					</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/sphere_ks_mid.png" width="600px"/>
						<figcaption>Cloth with standard spring constant</figcaption>
					</td>
			  </tr>

						<img src="img/sphere_ks_high.png" width="600px"/>
						<figcaption>Cloth with high spring constant</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<br/>
		As seen in the images, the cloth with a low spring constant has less structure, 
		and hugs the sphere more closely. There are more folds in the cloth as well. As 
		the spring constant increases, the cloth appears more stiff and does not hug 
		the sphere as much when at rest.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		In order to handle self collision, we need to determine when two point masses 
		are close to each other. Checking every point mass against each other point mass 
		is slow, so we use a hashing algorithm to separate the point masses into discrete 
		sections of space. The hashing algorithm takes in the position of a point mass, and 
		returns a value that will be the same for any point masses within that same particular 
		box of space. Then, we use this to map point masses to other nearby point masses, meaning 
		we only have to calculate distance between pairs within the same hashed box. 
		After the hashing part was implemented, it was just a matter of checking the 
		distance between pairs of point masses, and pushing them apart if they are within 
		a certain small distance of one another.

		<p>Below are some images of a cloth falling vertically onto a plane with self collision</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/self_fall_0.png" width="400px"/>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/self_fall_1.png" width="400px"/>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/self_fall_2.png" width="400px"/>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/self_fall_3.png" width="400px"/>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>Modifying the density and spring constant of the cloth produces different self collision results</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/self_density_low.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Low density cloth</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/self_density_high.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>High density cloth</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/self_ks_low.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Low spring constant cloth</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/self_ks_high.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>High spring constant cloth</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<br/>
		As seen here, the low density and high spring constant cloth has more structure 
		and crumples less as it falls. It also looks a lot nicer than the high density 
		and low spring constant cloths, at least with this point mass resolution.

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		Vertex shaders are responsible for processing the geometry of an object and 
		may apply physical transforms to that geometry, like offsetting vertices 
		or changing normal vectors. Fragment shaders receive the information processed 
		by vertex shaders, and use that to determine actual color values for the fragment, 
		outputting these to be rendered.

		<br/>
		<br/>
		The Blinn-Phong shading model combines diffuse, specular, and ambient shading 
		to generate realistic-looking shading on objects. The diffuse shading is light 
		which is scattered upon hitting the surface, preferring no particular reflection 
		direction. Matte surfaces have primarily diffuse shading. Specular shading is 
		light that is reflected less randomly, tending to be reflected at an angle equal 
		or close to the incident angle. This creates highlights on objects and is especially 
		apparent on metallic or glossy surfaces. To render these specular highlights, 
		the Blinn-Phong model calculates the bisector of the light's incident vector and 
		the vector from the light's intersect point to the camera, and then compares that 
		to the normal vector of the surface. If these vectors are very close to one another,
		then there will be a brighter specular highlight. Ambient lighting is constant 
		lighting from the environment that does not rely on light sources, which can 
		emulate indirect lighting in ray tracing.

		<p>Below are examples of the different elements of Blinn-Phong shading</p>

		<p>Below are some examples of bump and displacement shaders</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				<tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="img/disp_128.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Displacement and bump mapping, sphere with high vertex density</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">

						<figcaption>Displacement and bump mapping, sphere with low vertex density</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>

						<img src="img/bump_16.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Bump mapping only, sphere with low vertex density</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<br/>
		Bump mapping creates the appearance of a textured surface by updating the surface 
		normals according to some texture file. Displacement mapping, on the other hand, 
		actually physically displaces the vertices according to a texture file. As seen 
		above, displacement produces nice results on meshes that have a higher density of 
		vertices, because it can accurately recreate a surface texture. With low vertex 
		density, it looks a bit odd. In this case, only using bump mapping is probably 
		the better option. The sphere remains spherical but it also has the appearance 
		of a textured surface.
